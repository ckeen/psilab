* Notes

    The development version of Ypsilon is needed.

    dzen2 is used to display a pager.

    dmenu is used for the window menus.

    The first time you start cons-wm, there will be a noticeable delay
    while Ypsilon compiles the xlib library in the background. After
    that, it will start much faster.
